# 1.Data vs. Information in Your Bank App: When you check your banking app, you see your current balance. What is the raw data that had to be collected and processed to generate that single piece of information (your balance)?
When you check your balance in the banking app, the raw data includes things like deposits, withdrawals, fees, and interest. This data is processed by the bank to calculate your balance. The information you see in the app is the final result of this processing, showing your current balance after adding and subtracting all the transactions.
# 2.The 'System' of Online Shopping: Describe your process for buying a textbook online (from search to checkout). Identify one piece of hardware and one piece of software that is essential for this system to function.
To buy a textbook online, I start by using a smartphone (hardware) and open a web browser (software) to access an online bookstore; I then search for the textbook title, compare prices and editions, check reviews or seller ratings, add the correct item to my shopping cart, proceed to checkout, enter my shipping address and payment information, and finally confirm the order to complete the purchase.
# 3.People' as IS Components: Think about your experience with university registration. Who are the different "People" involved in that system (not just you), and what unique process does each person enable?
In the university registration system, students register for courses, academic advisors guide course selection, professors manage course availability, registrar staff handle enrollment and records, and IT staff maintain the system to ensure everything runs smoothly.
# 4.From Data to Actionable Information: You use a fitness tracker (or health app). What is one type of raw data it collects, and how does the system transform it into actionable information that makes you change your behavior?
A fitness tracker collects raw data like the number of steps you take each day, then processes this data to show you summaries or goals—such as how close you are to reaching 10,000 steps—which motivates you to walk more and stay active.
# 5.Failure of Integration: Describe a time when two systems (e.g., your university email and the course system) failed to work together smoothly. Was this a failure of data, software, or process integration? Explain briefly.
Once, my university email and course system failed to sync, so I didn’t receive important course announcements; this was a failure of software integration because the two platforms didn’t properly connect to share data in real time.
# 6.The Process of Creating "Information": When you write a weekly summary for a class project, you are acting as an Information System. Which step in your process (e.g., filtering, synthesizing, summarizing) is the most critical for turning data into quality information?
The most critical step is synthesizing, because it involves combining and interpreting the data to create meaningful insights that form the foundation of quality information.
# 7.Hardware's Invisible Role: Beyond your personal computer, where does the crucial hardware for a large-scale system like LINE or WeChat actually reside? Name one type of hidden hardware and its function.
For large-scale systems like LINE or WeChat, crucial hardware resides in data centers, where powerful servers store and process user data, handle messaging, and keep the apps running smoothly behind the scenes.
# 8.Software as the 'Logic': Imagine a simple elevator system. The software is the logic. If the elevator ignores a call because it's full, which part of the IS definition is the software enforcing? (Hint: Think about rules).
In the elevator system, the software acts as the logic that enforces specific rules or constraints within the Information System to ensure proper operation. When the elevator ignores a call because it’s full, the software is applying a rule that limits the number of passengers based on safety and capacity guidelines. This prevents overloading, maintains safety standards, and manages the elevator’s operation efficiently. So, the software is responsible for controlling behavior by following predefined rules that govern how the system responds to different situations.
# 9.Identifying a True Information System: Is a simple spreadsheet (like a Google Sheet) used to track inventory a complete Information System? Using the full definition (H/S/D/P/P), what is it missing or what component is the weakest?
A simple spreadsheet used to track inventory is an Information System but a basic one; it includes hardware (computer), software (spreadsheet program), data (inventory records), and people (users), but its weakest component is usually processes, since it lacks automated workflows, validation, and integration that make the system more efficient and reliable.
# 10.The Purpose of IS in Your Career: Based on the IS purpose (support decision-making, communication, operations), which of these three goals will be the most valuable to your future job in Information Management? Why?
The most valuable goal for my future job in Information Management will be supporting decision-making, because managing and analyzing data to provide accurate insights helps organizations make smarter, faster choices that improve efficiency and outcomes.
