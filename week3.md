# Tell the AI: "Explain 'what is an information system' in a way that a 5-year-old kid can understand."

ans: An information system is like a big brain for a computer. It helps the computer listen, think, and talk to people. Imagine you have a toy robot that can talk to you. Inside the robot is a special system that helps it know what you say, think of the best answer, and then talk back to you.
So, an information system helps a computer or robot get information, understand it, and then give you the right answers!
